# Simple WebRTC video chat application

Offer and Answer have to be created/added manually

This project is me learning about webrtc and how to create a simple video
chatting application

## WebRTC

It is a technology that lets the connection happen between two peers without
the need of a server

## How does it connect?

First, the client that wants to establish a connection, sends an offer - which
is basically an object that includes ip address, video format and other details -
and the requested client will generate an answer after getting the offer, both
clients will have an offer and the answer. Once offer and answer has been set,
the connection will be established and both can chat, video chat, send file, etc
without the need of a server
